# Module 2 – Activity 4 – Guessing Game (Dart)

Practice loops and hints by building a number guessing game.

## What to do

### 1. Fill in your details

Open `student.json` and fill in every field (use the **class code** your
instructor gave you):

```json
{
  "classCode": "1234",
  "fullName": "Juan Dela Cruz",
  "studentNumber": "2026-12345",
  "studentEmail": "juan.delacruz@hau.edu.ph",
  "personalEmail": "juan@example.com",
  "githubAccount": "juandelacruz"
}
```

> **Keep `student.json` identical across all your activities.** The autograder
> cross-checks these fields between your repos, and a mismatch (e.g. a different
> `classCode` in one activity) is flagged. The `classCode` must also match the
> one in your repo name.

### 2. Write the program

Open [`bin/guessing.dart`](bin/guessing.dart). The program must:

1. Keep a **magic number** stored in the code. Use **`42`** so the autograder
   can check your work.
2. Ask the player to guess the magic number.
3. Give a **hint** after each guess: if the guess is too low, say to try a
   **higher** number; if it is too high, say to try a **lower** number.
4. Keep asking until the player guesses the magic number.
5. When they get it, display **how many guesses** it took.

Run it yourself:

```bash
dart run bin/guessing.dart
```

## Set up your repo

Before you write any code, create **your own copy** of this activity from the
template. Do not work in the template itself.

1. **Create from the template.** Open the template repo and click
   **Use this template → Create a new repository**.
2. **Set the owner to the course org.** Under *Owner*, choose the **`HAU-6ADET`
   course org**, **not** your personal account.
3. **Name it by the convention** `m<module>a<activity>-<classcode>-<yourname>`.
   For this activity that's **`m2a4-<classcode>-yourname`** (e.g.
   `m2a4-1234-juandelacruz`). The `<classcode>` must match the one you put in
   `student.json`.
4. **Make it Private.** Set *Visibility* to **Private** so classmates can't see
   your work.

Then clone **your** new repo and work there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HAU-6ADET/m2a4-<classcode>-yourname.git
cd m2a4-<classcode>-yourname
```

## Running the test

```bash
dart pub get
dart test
```

This activity is graded by **4 tests** (1 point each). They check:

- ✅ `student.json` is completely filled in (1 test)
- ✅ the hint points in the right direction (higher / lower) and the final
  guess count is reported (3 tests)

Each part is graded independently, so you earn partial credit for the parts
you finish.

## Confirm your submission

Your repo **is** your submission, so there is nothing to upload anywhere. When the
test passes locally, **commit and push** so your work is recorded:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Activity 4 complete"
git push
```

Pushing triggers the **Autograde** workflow. Confirm your submission landed:

1. Open your repo on GitHub and click the **Actions** tab.
2. Open the latest **Autograde** run and confirm the green ✅ check
   and the "4 / 4 tests passed" summary.
